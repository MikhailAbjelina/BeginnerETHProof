This project is a simplification of how minting and burning tokens work using the Solidity language.

## Description
The project shows how burning and minting tokens work. It was written in Solidity and is able to perform hypothetical minting and burning functions.
The functions inside the program are mint() and burn(), which contain the procedures necessary for the minting and burning process

### Executing program
To run the program, simply copy the entire code and paste it into any Remix browser.
To actually run it, deploy it in the Remix IDE.
To add value, copy the address in the acount area and paste it into the address next to the burn and mint fucntions, then add the value.
